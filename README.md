# Industry-Grade-Project
## Aim of the Project
To build a Machine Learning model to predict whether an owner will initiate an auto insurance claim in the next year
## Use cases
1. Conquering Market Share: Capture market share by lowering the prices of the premium
for the customers, who are least likely to claim. 
2. Risk Management: Charge the right premium from the customer, who is likely to claim
insurance in the coming year 
3. Smooth Processing: Reduce the complexity of pricing models. Most of the transactions
are happening online with larger customer attributes (thanks to the internet and social
media). Harness the power of huge data to build complex ML models 
4. Increased Profits: As per industry estimate 1% reduction in the claim can boost profit by
10%. So, through the ML model, we can identify and deny the insurance to the driver
who will make a claim. Thus, ensuring reduced claim outgo and increased profit. 
## Dataset Description 
The project involves the use of a dataset with 600k training data and 57 features/data. In the
train and test data, features that belong to similar groupings are tagged as such in the feature
names (e.g., ind, reg, car, calc). In addition, feature names include the postfix bin to indicate
binary features and cat to indicate categorical features. Features without these designations
are either continuous or ordinal. Values of -1 indicate that the feature was missing from the
observation. The target column signifies whether a claim was filed for that policy holder.
## Result
F1 Score and Accuracy Scores of all used Machine Learning Models, comparing that **XG Boost Classifier** model given best performing and giving best result comparing to all other models.
